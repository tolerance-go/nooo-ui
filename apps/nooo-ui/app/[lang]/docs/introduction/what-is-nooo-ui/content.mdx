# What is Nooo-UI?

`nooo-ui` is a completely open source online design hub based on `tailwindcss`. You'll find a wealth of design resources here and it's easy to integrate into most of the development frameworks you're using.

<br />

# Motivation

We love `tailwindcss` to death, and it's exciting that as of January 2023, it has surpassed `Bootstrap` to become the most downloaded `css` framework on `npm`.

As the number of users increases, there are more and more design deposits. We hope to collect, process, display and share them as much as possible. Other users can find these "templates" they need at a very low cost, draw inspiration from them and further improve development efficiency.

If you happen to think so, we're looking forward to your PR, Salute!
